Working effectively?
We worked effectively together as team and split off to work on individual tasks and came back together.

What would you do differently next time?
* Add more tests.
* Modularise compents further.
* Use css.module to style individual components.
* Use image component for optimization.
* Implement cookies.

## Project outcomes 
* Completed core user stories, able to display products and individual product pages and able to add to the basket. 

Recommendations and conclusions 
* as above.
 
## Planning
Paolo: Devops/UX/UI
Miah: QA
Juliette: Facilitator

## What interesting technical problems did you have to solve?
* Ensure promises are returned so an error isn't thrown if undefined.
* Adding baseURL to cypress.json 
* Using image components rather than img tag - picked up by ES lint.

How did you debug issues that arose?
* console.logs, going back to next.js, code reading other cohorts project, watched tutorials, flagged to mentors.

Deployment
* We deployed early on vercel and this was automatically updated when we pushed to main.
* Vercel gave us a chance to preview branches before pushing to main.
